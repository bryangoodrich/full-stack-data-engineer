# So You Want To Be A Data Engineer?

## UPDATES COMING ##

With the use of codespaces and my website coming along, I plan to take a different approach to this content. While it is on hold for now, I will revisit it as a series of codespaces that can be worked through to help develop core DE skills, using the codespaces and online data sources as a way to easily integrate the practices on any machine from anywhere in a seamless way. 

If anyone is interested in helping me make this kind of content available, please feel free to ping me here. I welcome the support!

--------------------------------------------
What does it mean to be a full stack data engineer? Like a full stack developer handles both backend and frontend development for a website, a full stack engineer is precisely somebody that develops for a data plaform from data collection to its consumption. 

This training material will cover this in 4 sections. 

1. Data collection, tools, and pipelines
1. Storage systems and data modeling
1. Algorithms for analytics and dimensional modeling
1. Data consumption, reporting, and dashboarding

## Data Sets

We will use a number of large data sets throughout this build. If you cannot use the full referenced data set, a sample amount will be included here. Simply copy it to your data folder and proceed accordingly.
