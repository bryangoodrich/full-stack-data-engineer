# So You Want To Be A Data Engineer?

This training material will cover this in 4 sections. 

1. Data collection, tools, and pipelines
1. Storage systems and data modeling
1. Algorithms for analytics and dimensional modeling
1. Data consumption, reporting, and dashboarding

## Data Sets

We will use a number of large data sets throughout this build. If you cannot use the full referenced data set, a sample amount will be included here. Simply copy it to your data folder and proceed accordingly.
